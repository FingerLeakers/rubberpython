USB-Rubber-Ducky...but in python

Designed to be used with a Raspberry PI Zero W.

This is not a substitute for a real Rubber Ducky but is meant to be used as a tool to help writing and testing duckyscripts since you do not need to compile the scripts to test them.

Work in progress. Will probably not work 100%

# Extended commands

REM - Will write comment to stdout to aid during debuggning.

QUIT - Will stop running the script, useful if you want to try a portion of your script.
